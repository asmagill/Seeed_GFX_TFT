Seeed_GFX_TFT
=============

This library enables the 2.8" TFT Touch Shield V1.0 to be used with the Adafruit GFX library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

This library has been tested with the Arduino UNO and DFRobot's Bluno. Due to heavy use of port registers for pin manipulation, it is likely that this library will require modification if you wish to use it with a board that does not conform closely to the Uno's layout.
